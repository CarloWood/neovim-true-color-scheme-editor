Requirements:

You need to have 'nvr' installed in your PATH.
See https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote

To compile:

Edit Nvr.cpp and set NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS to whatever
value you want.

$ qmake
$ make

Install 'colorpicker' anywhere (or just run it from where it was compiled).

Usage:

$ NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS="/tmp/nvim_listen_address" nvim somefile.cpp

Put your cursor on a color that you wish to change and press <F10>
(or whatever key you did bind this to, see dot_config_nvim/README-init.vim)
which will show the syntax group that you need to change (after 'hi').

Then run 'colorpicker [syntax_group]' to edit that syntax group.
See ~/.config/nvim/colors/cwcolors.vim for all possible values of 'syntax_group',
for example 'cStatement', 'cppExceptions', 'cppModifier' etc.

When satisfied *copy* the hex value from the color picker with
your mouse *before* closing the color picker window, because it
won't safe it automatically, and edit cwcolors.vim manually.
Test by closing and reopening the .cpp file.

Note that colorpicker only changes the foreground OR the background
color -- and which -- is hardcoded in Nvr.cpp. At the time of writing only
"Search" and syntax groups containing the substring "Error" change
the background color.
