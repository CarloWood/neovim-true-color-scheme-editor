To compile:

Edit Nvr.cpp and set NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS to whatever
value you want.

$ qmake
$ make

Install 'colorpicker' anywhere (or just run it from where it was compiled).

Usage:

In a terminal do:

$ export NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS="/tmp/nvim_listen_address"
$ nvim somefile.cpp

Then run 'colorpicker [syntax_group]' to edit that syntax group.
See ~/.vim/colors/cwcolors.vim for possible values of 'syntax_group',
for example 'cStatement', 'cppExceptions', 'cppModifier' etc.

When satisfied *copy* the hex value from the color picker with
your mouse *before* closing the color picker window, because it
won't safe it automatically, and edit cwcolors.vim by hand. Test
by closing and reopening the .cpp file.
